DeMastri Approach
---- 8-Dec-20 - DeMastri
 - created working branch and progress file
 - part 1 outline:
 -  init, then read dir, then read files, then rename, then chmod, then utime
 - readdir and getattr nominally working but needs significant cleanup
---- 9-Dec-20 - DeMastri
 - part 1 complete and testing is done, needs some refactoring around common translate / get inode code
---- 10-Dec-20 - DeMastri
 - started on part 2 - mddir, rmdir, create, unlink all complete and testing is done
 - everything needs some refactoring
---- 11-Dec-20 - DeMastri
 - completed part 2 - write, truncate - not sure about mknod
 - negative tests for write and truncate still to be written
 - everything still needs some refactoring
---- 12-Dec-20 - DeMastri
 - completed part 2 - confirmed with prof jump that mknod is _internal_ don't need to write explicitly
 - negative tests for write and truncate complete
 - added a few negative tests for read and chmod as well
---- 13-Dec-20 - DeMastri
- changes/bugs suggested by aly - statvfs_f_blocks is now correct, and too long
files are trunc'd but pass

Sultan Approach
---- 11-Dec-20 - Sultan
 - Completed path traversal
 - Tentative Implementation 
    -- readdir
    -- getattr
    -- rename
    -- read
    -- chmod
 - Validation with DeMastri unittests-1
    -- tests failing:
        --- small_read
        --- chmod 
        --- rename
---- 12-Dec-20 - Sultan
 - Fixed bugs in chmod, rename, read, all unittests-1 pass
 - Tentative Implementation
    -- create
    -- mkdir
    -- unlink
    -- rmdir
 - Validation with DeMastri unittests-2
    -- all Implementations pass
 - Updated unittests-1 with new negatives, all pass
 - valgrind check, no leak for unittest-1 and unittest-2
 - suggested to DeMastri: fix for statvfs blcok return value 
 - suggested to DeMastri: allowing long names with truncation
---- 13-Dec-20 - Sultan
 - Tentative Implementation
    -- write
    -- truncate
    -- utime
 - Validation with DeMastri unittests-2
    -- unittest fix for fs_write return (number of bytes written is returned on success)
    -- all Implementations pass
 - Merged Sultan solution + DeMastri unittests into master
